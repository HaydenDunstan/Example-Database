# Example-Database
My first Database System which I designed and created myself

The problem this database was designed to solved is outlined in problem-statement.txt

My ER diagram model of how the database would function is found in gn-model.pdf

My outlined set of relations(relational schema) for my database is in gng.md

My postgreSQL table creation commands for creating the database and sample data are in gng-construct.sql

Some example queries for using this database are in gng-queries.sql
